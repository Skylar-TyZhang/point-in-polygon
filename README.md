# point-in-polygon
Algorithm to solve point in polygon problem
The algorithm includes the following steps:
1. The minimum bounding rectangle algorithm
2. The Ray Casting Algorithm.

The `main_from_file.py`:
1. Read list of x,y coordinates from CVS file and create polygon object from them.
2. Read and create points.
3. Categorise the points and write results into a csv file.
4. Plot the points and polygon.

The `main_from_user.py' takes point coordinates form user input.
